# Getting sequencing data from SRA

## Brief Intro
Microlbiome read sequencing data may be obtained from different sources. The most common ones include:

1. Reads directly from a sequencing platforms.
2. Reads downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) or the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
3. Reads synthesized using sequencing simulators.
