## Downloading multiple fastq files
- Make sure that the `fasterq-dump` is in the path.
- Type `which fasterq-dump` or `fasterq-dump --help` to confirm.
- Must specify the output and temporary files.
- It is possible to specifies a range of SRA accessions in a `for loop`.

Example code for download reads for SRA accessions ranging from SRR7450706 to SRR7450761

```bash
for (( i = 706; i <= 761; i++ ))
	do
        time fasterq-dump SRR7450$i \
        --split-3 \
        --force \
        --skip-technical \
        --outdir data/reads \
        --temp data/temp \
        --threads 4		
	done
```

## Compressing and uncompressing files
The microbiome fastq files are usually very large. Compressing them may save lots of space. 

Uncompressing with bash
```bash
gunzip data/reads/*.gz
```

Compressing with bash
```bash
gzip data/reads/*.fastq
```
